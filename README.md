### Predictive Maintenance for Healthcare Equipment

This project aims to proactively predict whether healthcare equipment is likely to require maintenance within the next 10 days. The goal is to minimize unexpected breakdowns, reduce repair costs, and enhance patient safety by enabling data-driven maintenance planning.
Healthcare institutions rely on critical equipment like ventilators, infusion pumps, MRI machines, and surgical instruments. Unexpected failures can have serious consequences for patient care and operational efficiency. This solution leverages machine learning to assess equipment condition based on usage logs, environmental parameters, and operational metadata to predict maintenance needs ahead of time.


### Use Cases

Preventive Healthcare: Identify equipment prone to failure before it occurs, ensuring continuous availability of life-critical devices.

Cost Reduction: Lower maintenance and downtime costs through early detection and planned maintenance scheduling.

Operational Efficiency: Improve equipment availability in high-dependency areas like ICU, Surgery, and Emergency departments.

Scalable Solution: Designed to work across various departments and equipment types with role-based access control.
